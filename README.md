### Introduction
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). <br>

Where's Waldo involves identifying small objects amidst many other objects using the mouse. Similar to photo tagging, each click 
has a bounding box with a dropdown to select which character you believe exists at those coordinates. The primary task is 
to determine whether the game logic is correct, and how fast it takes a player to find all the characters. <br>

The project was built with NextJS, MongoDB (atlas), and mongoose. The entire stack was built in nextJS and I included a public api within 
the application. Game logic was implemented on server components to prevent cheating and accessed using a combination of server functions 
(actions) and `useEffect` calls. Using nextJs helped to cutout the express requirement for a backend server and I didn't implement any 
authentication but overall, the express logic feels closer to flask logic from python, and I prefer it to next.

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.


### API routes
| Name | Description |
| :--- | :---------- |
| GET `/api/checkdb` | Verify the mongodb connection |
| GET `/api/game` |  Retrieve all games |
| POST `/api/game` |  Save a new game with associated target and bounding boxes |
| GET `/api/game/:gameId` |  Retrieve specific game |
| GET `/api/game/:gameId/checkmove` | Check whether a clicked point is inside a bounding box |
| GET `/api/leaderboard` | Retrieve all the game leaderboards |
| GET `/api/leaderboard/:gameId` | Retrieve specific game leaderboard |
| POST`/api/leaderboard/:gameId` | Create a leaderboard entry for a specific game |

Checking each players move serverside is generally slow. Also the main component is bloated with multiple state variables being 
tracked, the timer causes a re-rendering of the entire page even though I separated it into its own component. It works but it 
can be improved to be more responsive.


### Database
I used MongoDB for this project because it felt easier to implement objects like bounding boxes in a NoSQL db vs. a 
relational db. I also wanted to get working experience with the mongoose ODM instead of prisma for learning purposes. In the 
DATABASE_URL,
```bash
DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<clusterName>.vutxdmd.mongodb.net/<DATABASENAME>?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=ClusterOdin
```
The _DATABASENAME_ is missing by default, and I had to manually insert it after creating a database on mongo atlas. The collection / 
table name can also be created in mongo. <br>
To query the database locally, I downloaded MongoDB compass which is like a replacement for prisma studio. It allows you to update 
documents (db entries) interactively within a gui.


### Mongoose Issues
Connecting to mongoose with the latest version was giving my IP whitelist errors and the temptation to use prisma was high but I stuck 
through it and found this [article](https://medium.com/@ayiaware/resolving-mongodb-connection-issues-beyond-ip-whitelisting-f4c132c2a9a8).
Installing `mongoose@8.3.4` partially resolved the whitelist issues for me.
- Get ip address from terminal `ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -Fv 127.0.0.1 | awk '{print $2}'` or go to https://www.whatismyip.com/ and 
    check your ip address.
- I ended up reverting back to the latest version because the issue was with the University's internet. Using my mobile hotspot allowed me 
    to whitelist my ip.
- Sometimes after making a schema change within the db collection, the app wouldn't recognize the change. Restart the dev server or delete 
    the `.next` directory and restart the server to update the changes.

>[!Important]
> When you add your ip address, mongo includes a `/32` behind it which prevents it from working e.g. `216.201.252.184/32`, replace the 32 
    with **`0`** to make it work `216.201.252.184/0`

### Prisma
After multiple failed attempts with Mongoose (24h limit), I decided to try prisma. To set up prisma with mongo
- Run `npx prisma init` to create the schema file
- Populate the schema config and add a simple schema  
    ```prisma
    datasource db {
    provider     = "mongodb"
    url          = env("DATABASE_URL")
    }

    model Images {
    id        String   @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
    url       String
    width     Int
    height    Int
    createdAt DateTime @default(now())
    updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
    }
    ```
- Then run `npx prisma generate` and `npx prisma db push`. Mongodb collections cannot be migrated, and the migration command does not 
    work, hence the `db push` option.
- To use it in NextJS, create a `/src/lib/db.js` file. This is similar to the `/config/prisma.js` file in node express, and its used to 
    unify the prisma client import across the application
    ```JS
    import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

    const db = global.prisma || new PrismaClient();

    if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") global.prisma = db;

    export default db
    ```
- Create a `/src/app/api` directory to work with server side apis in NextJS. For each route, create a folder with a `route.js` file. 
    You can define REST api requests like get,post,delete etc for each route and access the db on the server side
- Update your `package.json` scripts to include a postinstall
    ```json
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "next dev --turbopack",
        "build": "next build",
        "start": "next start",
        "lint": "next lint",
        "postinstall": "prisma generate"
    },
    ```
- After all the prisma setup, it didn't work with the mongo db free tier because prisma uses transactions for mongodb insertions and 
    transactions are not available on the free tier, so I reverted to Mongoose.

### Additional Features
- I included skeleton loaders that mimic the page outline during loading states. 
- The leaderboard modal is simpler and more efficient
